        <p>
          When you're in the early days of photographing the night sky, it can
          be hard to know where to start to get the best results. In this
          astrophotography for beginners guide, we have put together some steps
          to help you get the most out of capturing the night sky at its best.
        </p>

        <p>
          The subject of astrophotography is so broad with so many subcategories
          that it might feel daunting to get started, but in this guide, we've
          concentrated our knowledge into a beginner's guide to astrophotography
          that will equip you, most importantly, with basic techniques, but also
          some suggestions of creative ways to capture the night sky.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before you start, you'll need to invest a little bit of money in
          purchasing the right camera. We've suggested the best cameras for
          astrophotography and the best lenses for astro to help get you started
          with this element. In general, you'll want to concentrate your
          purchasing on the best lens you can buy – don't worry about spending a
          little less on the camera, as ultimately, it's the quality of the
          glass that will make a difference. You'll also want to look at some
          accessories like tripods, lens heaters and of course, a good warm coat
          for long periods standing outdoors.
